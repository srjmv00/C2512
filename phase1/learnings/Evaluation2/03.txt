Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the 
`Beginner Level Problem Statement` 
for Linux commands in C++ development.

---

1. `Basic File and Directory Management`:

`Create a directory for your C++ project`:
```bash
mkdir my_cpp_project

```
This will create a new directory called `my_cpp_project`.

`List files in a directory`:
```bash
ls
```
This will list all the files and directories in the current directory.

2.`Change to the project directory`:
```bash
cd my_cpp_project

```
This will move you into the `my_cpp_project` directory.

3. Create a file :
```bash
touch greet.cpp

```
This will create a greet.cpp file.

4. `Write a simple C++ program`:

Create the `greet.cpp` file with a simple program, 
using `nano`
```bash
nano greet.cpp

```
Add this code inside `greet.cpp`:
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

	char name[255];
	cout << "enter the name : " << endl;
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Greetings " << name << endl;
	
	return 0;
}

```
5. `Compile the C++ program``:
You can open and edit `greet.cpp` using `nano` :

Make any necessary changes and then save the file 
by pressing `^X,then type `y` then enter`

```bash
g++ greet.cpp
```

This compiles `greet.cpp` and creates an executable called `a.out`.

6. `Run the compiled program`:
```bash
./a.out
```
The output should be:
```
enter the name : 
sooraj
Greetings sooraj

```
---

7. `display the contents`:
Using `cat` to View File Content`
```bash
cat greet.cpp
```
This will display the contents of greet.cpp

8. `Modify the `greet.cpp` file `:

`Edit the C++ file`:
You can open and edit `number_check.cpp` using `nano` :
```bash
 nano greet.cpp
```
 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

	char name[255];
	cout << "enter the name : " << endl;
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Good Bye " << name << endl;
	
	return 0;
}

Make any necessary changes and then save the file 
by pressing `^X,then type `y` then enter`
---

9. `Compile and run the modified program `:

`Compile the C++ file`:
```bash
g++ greet.cpp
```
This will compile the `greet.cpp` file.
---

`Run the compiled program`:

```bash
 ./a.out
 
```
enter the name : 
sooraj
Good Bye sooraj


10. `Delete the program file`:

``Remove the C++ file`:
```bash
 rm greet.cpp a.out
```
This will delete the `greet.cpp` file and a.out executable.

11. `Remove an empty directory`:
```bash
rmdir my_cpp_project


```
This will delete the `my_cpp_project` directory if it's empty.
```
